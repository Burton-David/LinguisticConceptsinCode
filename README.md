## Rules of Language/AKA Grammar
* phonology - sound system, 
* morphology - structure of words
* syntax - sentences created by word combinations
* semantics - the ways in which sounds and meanings are related
* lexicon - Most commonly known and used words

**Reminder**
There is almost never a relationship between the way a word's pronunciation or sign and its meaning
